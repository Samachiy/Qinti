Qinti UI is an open source frontend made with Godot for image generation that aims to be both easy to use and for professional use.

It also comes in the form of an executable, so the frontend itself doesn't need to be installed, just click and run, it is currently available for Linux and Windows.

The project uses the AGPL license to ensure that it will always be free and open source.

# Getting Started

## Installation

### Windows

1. Download
2. Decompress
3. Run Qinti.exe

### Linux

1. Download
2. Decompress
3. Make Qinti.x86_64 executable
4. Run Qinti.x86_64

## First steps

To use Qinti, it is necessary to specify a Automatic1111 Web UI installation or let Qinti install one, both options will be shown during the first program run:
- On the first option it is necessary to open the installation path and maybe specify extra arguments. A set of arguments will automatically load depending on the system but if the specified arguments are not enough, it is possible to specify extra arguments.
- On the second option it is only necessary to specify an installation folder and press “install”.

After a valid installation is set, Qinti will display a few short tutorials to explain the user interface
